# conda-build3:

some information about changes/ possebilities with cb3:

## use config-yaml to select compilers:
```
c_compiler:
  - gcc-dbg  # [linux]
  - clang-dbg  # [osx] 
cxx_compiler:
  - gxx-dbg  # [linux]
  - clangxx-dbg  # [osx] 
```

allows to use debug compilers without touching the recipes.
But the recipe has to be prepared for this case. This is done by using some environment variables,
 which are generated by the activation scripts:
`OPT_CFLAGS` and `OPT_CPPFLAGS` 
`CFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS`
