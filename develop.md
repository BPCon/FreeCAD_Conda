# TESTING AND DEBUGGING FreeCAD with dependencies from conda

This section is for testing new branches, or your own implementations/additions of Freecad with conda. This is interesting, because conda gives us a nice way to gather all the sources we need to build FreeCAD. No need to download all the necessary libraries which have conflicts all over. Simple use the develop branch of this repo and follow this instruction.

- ```git clone https://github.com/looooo/FreeCAD_Conda # this branch```
- go to *FreeCAD_Conda/.FreeCAD_debug/build.sh* and modify the FREECAD_SOURCE Variable at the top of the document
Also have a look at the gcc options. An old version is needed! I have tested with 4.8 and 4.9. But most-likely the gcc shipped with conda is not compatible with the system libstd... So manually specifying gcc is necessary! This is not true for building with old linux versions. Especially if you build with docker and any-linux gcc from conda can be used(see build.md)

- in the terminal go to *FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug/*
- ```conda build . --python=3.5  # or 2.7```

when you have an error you can go to the build directory something like
~/miniconda3/conda-bld/FreeCAD_123423342/work
- ```source activate ../ # to activate the build enviroment```
- ```make # to build again```

you can also use the __--dirty__ flag but this will run cmake again, so there are more things getting rebuild
in the build directory you can also use cmake-gui.


# setup with KDevelop (linux)
## preperation:
- conda installed
- channeld freecad and conda-forge added

## setup
 1. build with conda
```bash
cd FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug
conda build . --python=3.5
# abort once cmake is ready
ln -s ~/conda/conda-bld/freecad_debug/...b_env... ~/conda/env/fc_debug
```
 2. activate the build environment
```source activate fc_debug```
 3. start kdevelop from terminal (fc_debug environment)
 4. open a project and choose the CMakeList.txt from FreeCAD
 5. set build dir to ~/conda/conda-bld/freecad_debug..../work
 6. in KDevelop press __Build__ (wait until build is done)
 7. configure executable in KDevelop:
- select FreeCAD in the project tree
- menu at top -> Run -> Configure Launches -> AddNew -> Compiled Binary
- check executable
- select *~/conda/conda-bld/freecad_debug/work/bin/FreeCAD*
 8. press __Execute__

if you want to run cmake again simple do:
```bash
cd FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug
conda build . --python=3.5 --dirty
```


## problems
- there is the chance the default conda and the build environment are using the same python version. If this is the case you should set the variable PYTHONHOME explicitly to the build environment.
in kdevelop: 
 - run / configure launches
 - select problematic version
 - Environmen (press on the button on the right side)
 - on top press the arrow-"x" and type a new name
 - "add new group"
 - in the table enter "PYTHONHOME" and as value look for the path to the build-environment
