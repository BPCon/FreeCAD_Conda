# TESTING AND DEBUGGING FreeCAD with dependencies from conda
This section is for testing new branches, or your own implementations/additions of Freecad with conda. This is interesting, because conda gives us a nice way to gather all the sources we need to build FreeCAD. No need to download all the necessary libraries which have conflicts all over. Simple use the develop branch of this repo and follow this instruction.

- ```git clone https://github.com/looooo/FreeCAD_Conda # this branch```
- go to *FreeCAD_Conda/.FreeCAD_debug/build.sh* and modify the FREECAD_SOURCE Variable at the top of the document

- in the terminal go to *FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug/*
- ```conda build . --python=3.5  # or 2.7```

when you have an error you can go to the build directory something like
~/miniconda3/conda-bld/FreeCAD_123423342/work
- ```source activate ../ # to activate the build enviroment```
- ```make # to build again```

you can also use the __--dirty__ flag but this will run cmake again, so there are more things getting rebuild
in the build directory you can also use cmake-gui.


# Kdevelop (linux)

1. build with conda
```bash
cd FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug
conda build . --python=3.5
# abort once cmake is ready
ln -s ~/conda/conda-bld/freecad_debug/...b_env... ~/conda/env/fc_debug
```
2. activate the build environment
```source activate fc_debug```
3. start kdevelop from terminal
4. open a project and choose the CMakeList.txt from FreeCAD
5. set build dir to ~/conda/conda-bld/freecad_debug..../work

if you want to run cmake again simple do:
```bash
cd FreeCAD_Conda/develop/FreeCAD_debug
conda build . --python=3.5 --dirty
```
